    <string name="aboutUs">ResUseR is a bridging platform(initially open to only Monash City Council residents) between the hard waste disposer and seeker. Its chief intention is the advocacy for a greener earth. This objective is achieved in two-fold:\n
1. Increasing hard waste reuse through the network of local residents before ending up in the landfill; thereby providing people with the means to contribute to the community and offering Melbournians with a means of accessing items that are still in good condition.\n
2. Promoting awareness on the importance of reusing hard waste through informatics and multilingual support.</string>

    <string name="monash_council">Monash Council</string>
    <string name="monashFact">The city of Monash is one of the most culturally rich councils in Melbourne, according to ABSâ€™ (Australian Bureau of Statistics) 2016 census. Home to almost 90,000 residents who were born overseas, this accounts for almost 49% of the population who are now calling Monash their new home.\n
Immigrants from an assortment of backgrounds (12.5% from China, 5.3% from India, 3.6% from Sri Lanka and more). In 2016, Monash City council collected 5,030 tonnes of hard waste (with only a 20% diversion rate), which required $1,030,000 in expenditure for its proper management. ResUseR believes in giving a second life to household reusables at the kerbside.</string>
